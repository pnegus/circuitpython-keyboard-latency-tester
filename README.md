# circuitpython-keyboard-latency-tester
code for using circuitpython esp32 to test mech keyboard latency

## Overview

`code.py` programs your esp32 to-- on the press of the debug button-- send an 'f' keypress followed by setting the 'g' switch contact high. It does this 20 times.

## Usage

- Load `code.py` to your circuitpython board

- Run KeyResponsePK (download from Bloody website-- though it doesn't seem to be hosted there anymore? [mirror](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kiUobSebUWdqPSi0QxpxsH_TUng1uGVF/view?usp=sharing))

- Press debug button
